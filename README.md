# How to Use Me

Assuming you are starting an app that you wish to call `rescue-mission` 

In your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/LaunchAcademy/rails-6-boilerplate
cd rails-6-boilerplate 
bundle
yarn install
```

If you prefer, **you can rename your project with the `mv` command.**

Starting from the directory above your app (likely challenges):
mv <source_directory> <target_directory>


Fantasy Book Reviews is an application that allows users to browse and add fantasy books and leave reviews about specific books. User can sign in and sign up through a form. When the user visits the Book List page, they can search the book database based on the book title, author or a year. If a certain book is not present in the database, the signed in user will be able to add it. Additionally, a signed in user can add a book review, which includes a rating and a comment. Admins will need to approve reviews and newly added books. 
For building this app I used the Open Library API. As a front end I used React.js and as a back end Ruby on Rails, and for styling I used Foundations and vanilla CSS.
